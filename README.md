- after trials and errors, I finally got a good grasp of flex box. the html section is what was really getting me, but I figured it out for the most part. Really happy about that. I got past where I left off before I completely redid the css. I fixed thing up with html, which is where I was struggling before. Happy and hope to complete this project over the weekend.

- finished the general idea. there's some scaling issue for wider screens and didnt scale for mobile either. Just wanted more practice with understanding flex box. Happy with the added skill and experience with it. May come back to added a little more to it, but I am content for now!
