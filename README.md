after trials and errors, I finally got a good grasp of flex box. the html section is what was really getting me, but I figured it out for the most part. Really happy about that. I got past where I left off before I completely redid the css. I fixed thing up with html, which is where I was struggling before. Happy and hope to complete this project over the weekend.
